/*2. After running and re-running the code multiple times the final counter
appears to always be correct (though it seems as though that is only by chance)
  3. Evidence that the threads are running concurrently:
    - When the child code runs and prints the current value of the counter,
    the counter does not appear to linearly increase. Sometimes it is 0 multiple
    times, sometimes it jumps from 0 to 3 and back to 0, etc.
    This is also an issue with synchronization, even though the final value of
    the counter is correct the intermediate values are not.
